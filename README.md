# CrystalBank
Smart contracts and Web3 UI for The Crystal Bank project

Project Overview
The Crystal Bank is an innovative in-game economic system that is integrated into a tabletop roleplaying game called The Chronicles of Auld Ewe. It enables players to deposit in-game resources called crystals (made out of fudment salts), convert them into the cryptocurrency $FUDDY (one of the 2024 Memethon winning projects), and engage in resource management and trading. By leveraging the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain, the system ensures security, transparency, and immersion in decentralized finance (DeFi).

Key functionalities include player registration, crystal deposits, $FUDDY conversions, trading, and GM-controlled resource distribution. An AI-driven economic system is part of the development plan to balance supply and demand, enhancing the realism and engagement of the in-game economy.

Flowchart for The Crystal Bank System
GM Player Registration
GMs register players onto the Crystal Bank platform using a dedicated registration contract.

Player Registration Confirmation
Players receive confirmation of their registration and access to the in-game economy.

Crystal Deposit
Players deposit crystals into their accounts via the Crystal Conversion contract.

Crystal Conversion
Players convert deposited crystals into $FUDDY based on predefined conversion rates.

FUDDY Transfer
Players transfer $FUDDY to external wallets via the FUDDY Transfer contract.

GM Distribution of Crystals
GMs distribute crystals to players as part of gameplay or NPC interactions.

Market Interaction
Players buy $FUDDY from external markets and transfer it into their game wallets.

Transaction Recording
All transactions are recorded on the blockchain for transparency and security.

NFT Creation
Players will be able to create NFTs based on achievements during designated schedules.

AI Economic Management System (Macro Manager)
An AI-driven system when deployed will monitor and adjust $FUDDY demand and supply dynamics.

GM's Dedicated Wallet Management
Each GM uses a unique wallet linked via QR code or hyperlink for resource management.

This repository contains all the smart contracts needed to make this project viable.
